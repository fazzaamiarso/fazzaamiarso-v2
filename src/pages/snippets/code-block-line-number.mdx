A trick to pre-pend line number to an HTML `code` element.

Using Vanilla CSS and CSS `counter`

```css
code {
  counter-reset: step;
  counter-increment: step 0;
}

/* Select the code line */
code .line::before {
  content: counter(step);
  counter-increment: step;
  margin-right: 1.5rem; /* Margin between line number and actual code element */
}
```
